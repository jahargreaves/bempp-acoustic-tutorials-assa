# Bempp acoustics exercises

This repository contains tutorials and exercises designed to show you how to use Bempp to solve problems in acoustics.
These materials were designed to be part of the [EAA / UKAN Computational Acoustics Summer School](https://acoustics.ac.uk/events/4468/).

You can view these tutorials and exercises [on nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/mscroggs/bempp-acoustic-tutorials/blob/main/README.ipynb).
