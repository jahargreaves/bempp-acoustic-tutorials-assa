# Bempp acoustics exercises

This repository contains tutorials and exercises designed to show you how to use Bempp to solve problems in acoustics.
These materials were designed to be part of the [EAA / UKAN Computational Acoustics Summer School](https://acoustics.ac.uk/events/4468/).

## Tutorial 1: Scattering from a sphere
The [first tutorial](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/mscroggs/bempp-acoustic-tutorials/blob/main/tutorials/1_sphere_scatterer.ipynb)
demonstrates two possible approaches for solving a rigid exterior scattering problem.

This tutorial should be used to complete the following exercises:

- [Dirichlet conditions](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/mscroggs/bempp-acoustic-tutorials/blob/main/exercises/1a_sphere_scatterer.ipynb).
  In this exercise, you will write your own code to solve a scattering problem with different boundary conditions to the tutorial.
- [Uniqueness](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/mscroggs/bempp-acoustic-tutorials/blob/main/exercises/1b_uniqueness.ipynb).
  In this exercise, you will investigate the effect of resonances on the solutions of boundary integral equations.
