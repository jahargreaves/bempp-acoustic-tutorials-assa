# Bempp acoustics exercises

This repository contains tutorials and exercises designed to show you how to use Bempp to solve problems in acoustics.
These materials were designed to be part of the [EAA / UKAN Computational Acoustics Summer School](https://acoustics.ac.uk/events/4468/).

You can view these tutorials and exercises [on nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/mscroggs/bempp-acoustic-tutorials/blob/main/README.ipynb).

  - The text at the top needs updating (currently copied from example 1)
  - Correctness and choice of parameters need checking
- [Exercise 3: Different impedences](exercises/3_impedences.ipynb)
  - This needs writing
- Tutorial ?: Loudspeaker
  - This needs writing or removing from the list
- Tutorial ?: Room acoustics
  - This needs writing or removing from the list
